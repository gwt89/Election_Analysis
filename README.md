# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee gave me the follow tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

•	Calculate the total number of votes cast

•	Create a complete list of the candidates who received votes

•	Add up the total number of votes each candidate received

•	Find the percentage of votes each candidate won

•	Figure out the winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
Data Source: election_results.csv
Software: Python 3.10, Visual Studio Code, 1.68.1
## Results
How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
369,711 votes were cast in this election. The first image shows my code in Visual Studio and the second image is the Terminal results.

Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
Which county had the largest number of votes? Denver had the largest number of votes and counted for most of the votes cast in the election. 82.8% of the vote came from Denver county alone. The first image shows the code written in Visual Studio and the second image is the Terminal results.

Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
The winner of the election was Diana DeGette who carried 73.8% of the vote and had 272,892 votes. Charles Stockham finished in 2nd and received 23% of the vote and 85,213 votes. Raymon Doane came in last place with 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes. The first image shows the code written in Visual Studio and the second image is the Terminal results.

## Summary
The script that was created for this audit could be adapted for almost any election. It could be used for elections at the local, state, and federal level. For local elections you could change or remove the county measurements and for presidential elections you could measure states rather than counties. You would also need to create code for the Electoral College as the popular vote is not the deciding factor in a presidential election.
